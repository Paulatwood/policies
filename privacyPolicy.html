<p class="p2"><b>My Driver Direct Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by MDD. The Policy relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology, including but not limited to via its website at www.mydriverdirect.com and any mobile applications and related services.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">MDD treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, MDD has systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal information.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD abides by the Australian Privacy Principles, which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure, use and storage of personal information. MDD’s objective is to handle information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is handled.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">The following defined terms are used in this Policy: Policy means this privacy policy.</p>
<p class="p3">Privacy Officer means the person whose details are specified in clause 8 of this Policy.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">MDD means My Driver Direct Pty Ltd ACN 613 881 995.</p>
<p class="p3">1. Collection of Personal Information</p>
<p class="p3">Personal information is information or opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. The nature of personal information collected by MDD generally comprises an individual's name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail) and opinions about products, services or staff. If possible and reasonably practical you will have the option of not identifying yourself or using a pseudonym in providing such information. However, if you do not identify yourself, MDD may not be able to give you the information and services you would otherwise receive. Such personal information is collected for the purposes of arranging, conducting and promoting MDD's business activities.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD does not collect personal information unless it is reasonably necessary for MDD to perform one or more of its functions and business activities. On occasion, some of this personal information may be sensitive and MDD will only collect it with your consent or when required to by law.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD will destroy personal information when it is no longer required for such functions and business activities.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, MDD may collect personal information via its website, mobile application, telephone, email or letter, or when you attend a function or event, provide a resume or enter an agreement.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">2. Use &amp; Disclosure of Personal Information</p>
<p class="p3">Personal information provided to MDD may be shared with related companies within MDD, where it will be kept strictly confidential and will only be disclosed on a need to know basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3">MDD will use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which the personal information was initially collected.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD may also use that personal information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes might include internal auditing and administration, adding your name to a contact list, guest list or invitation list</p>
<p class="p3">or helping us to identify business activities, services or investment opportunities which may be of benefit or interest to you.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent. MDD may however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is:</p>
<p class="p3">• required or authorised by law;</p>
<p class="p3">• required in order to investigate an unlawful activity;</p>
<p class="p3">• required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or</p>
<p class="p3">• necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health or safety, or to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="p3">Generally, MDD will retain your personal information within Australia and not use or disclose it overseas. However, on some occasions the information may need to be transferred overseas in order to perform one of MDD's functions or activities. In these circumstances, MDD will either obtain your express or implied consent or will take such steps as are reasonable to ensure that your personal information will receive protection similar to that which it would have if the information were in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="p3">Like most business organisations, MDD relies on third party suppliers who are contracted to conduct specialised activities such as insurance broking, supply of equipment, business services, security services and travel and hospitality services. While personal information may be provided to these suppliers in order to enable them to perform the agreed tasks, MDD will make every effort to ensure that the supplier handles the personal information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles and confidentiality principles. MDD will require all such suppliers to provide privacy undertakings and where necessary enter confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD may also share the information we collect with independent third party transportation or logistics providers under agreement with MDD or certain MDD affiliates, for example your first name, any feedback associated with your use of the MDD’s services and your pick up and drop off locations.</p>
<p class="p3">If you are a third party transportation or logistics provider under agreement with MDD or certain MDD affiliates, MDD may share information with a rider including your name, vehicle make, model, colour, license plate and location. If you choose to provide further profile information, this information may also be shared.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD may also need to provide your personal information to third parties where:</p>
<p class="p3">• MDD is (in limited circumstances) allowed or required to by law or where it has a public duty to do so. For example, a Court, a regulator (such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) or the Australian Tax Office (ATO)) or the police can compel the disclosure of personal information; or</p>
<p class="p3">• You have expressly consented to your personal information being supplied to others. Usually such consent will be required in writing however in special circumstances you may be able to provide consent verbally; or</p>
<p class="p3">• It can be reasonably inferred from the circumstance that you consent to your personal information being disclosed. For example your consent will be implied for MDD to use and disclose your information to inform you of products and services that MDD believes may interest you. However your implied consent may be withdrawn at any time.</p>
<p class="p3">We may sometimes have to transfer your personal information overseas. We will only do so in accordance with the Australia Privacy Principles and Australian privacy law in general.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">3. Direct marketing</p>
<p class="p3">From time to time MDD may use your personal information to identify business activities or investment opportunities which may be of interest to you.</p>
<p class="p3">If you do not wish to receive direct marketing information, please let MDD know. MDD will take immediate steps to ensure that you do not receive any direct marketing information in future.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">4. Personal Information Quality</p>
<p class="p3">MDD’s objective is to ensure that all personal information collected by us is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist MDD in achieving its objective, please contact us if any of your details change. Further, if you believe that the information MDD holds is not accurate, complete or up-to- date, please contact us in order to have the information corrected.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">5. Personal Information Security</p>
<p class="p3">MDD is committed to keeping your personal information secure, and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, loss, misuse or alteration.</p>
<p class="p3">Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents, or electronically on MDD's software or systems.</p>
<p class="p3">MDD maintains up-to-date techniques and processes which meet current industry standards to protect your personal information both through physical security over its paper and electronic data stores, such as locks and security systems, and computer and network security systems with firewalls, encryption technology and passwords to control and restrict access to authorise staff for approved purposes.</p>
<p class="p3">Where information is particularly sensitive, the information is overwritten and then manually deleted.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">6. Access to Personal Information</p>
<p class="p3">You may request access to the personal information MDD holds about you.</p>
<p class="p3">The procedure for gaining access is as follows:</p>
<p class="p3">• All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to the Privacy Officer.</p>
<p class="p3">• You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will allow MDD to process your request faster.</p>
<p class="p3">• MDD will acknowledge your request within 14 days, and access will usually be granted within 30 days or otherwise within a reasonable period after the request is made. MDD will inform you if this timeframe is not achievable.</p>
<p class="p3">• You will be asked to verify your identity.</p>
<p class="p3">• A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.</p>
<p class="p3">• Depending on the circumstances, MDD will make all reasonable attempts to give access to the information in the manner you requested. If the manner requested is not reasonable and/or practicable you may be forwarded the information by another means reasonable in the circumstances, for example by mail or email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place.</p>
<p class="p3">• You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is no longer accurate.</p>
<p class="p3">In some circumstances, MDD may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:</p>
<p class="p3">• access would create a serious threat to safety;</p>
<p class="p3">• providing access will have an unreasonable impact</p>
<p class="p3">upon the privacy of other individuals;</p>
<p class="p3">• denying access is required or authorised by law;</p>
<p class="p3">• the request is frivolous or vexatious;</p>
<p class="p3">• legal proceedings are underway or otherwise anticipated;</p>
<p class="p3">• negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or</p>
<p class="p3">• access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision</p>
<p class="p3">making process.</p>
<p class="p3">If MDD denies access to your personal information, it will provide you with reasons in writing.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">7. Changes to this Policy</p>
<p class="p3">MDD may change this Policy from time to time for any reason and will update the Policy accordingly.</p>
<p class="p1"><br></p>
<p class="p3">8. Complaints</p>
<p class="p3">If you believe that your privacy has been infringed you are entitled to complain. All complaints should initially be in writing and directed to the Privacy Officer on:</p>
<p class="p3">Name: The Director</p>
